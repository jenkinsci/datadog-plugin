<div>
    <p>Read a file from workspace as a newline seperated list of tags to push to DataDog. Location is relative to workspace</p>
    <p>Example: <em>os=${OS_PARAM}</em>.</p> 
    <p>The value can either be something that is automatically expanded in Jenkins, or a static value which you define for the tag</p>
    <p>The OS_PARAM in this case is a value that is expanded by Jenkins (Environment and/or build variable)</p>
