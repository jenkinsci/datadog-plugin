<div>
    Enter a comma separated list of tags that should be applied to all metrics, events, logs, service checks submitted by this Datadog Plugin. E.g.:
    <pre>
        instance:east, language:french
    </pre>

    Tags support the use of environment variables. The environment variables must be defined in the
    Jenkins controller instance. Eg:
    <pre>
        optional:$ENV_VAR
    </pre>
</div>
