<div>
    Enter a list of jobs and tags that should be applied for that job.
    The list of jobs is separated by newlines and can include comma separated tags. E.g.:
    <pre>
        susans-job, optional:tag1
        (.*?)-job, owner:$1
        (.*?)_job_(*?)_release, owner:$1, release_env:$2, optional:Tag3
    </pre>

    Tags support the use of environment variables. The environment variables must be defined in the
    Jenkins controller instance. Eg:
    <pre>
        susans-job, optional:$ENV_VAR
    </pre>
</div>
